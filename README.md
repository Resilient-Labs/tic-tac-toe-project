# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The game logic, event handling, and UI interactions are implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
