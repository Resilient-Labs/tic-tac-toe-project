## How It's Made:
Catgram is built using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript (JS)**: Employed for complex client-side functionality.

## What I Learned
- Organizing complex logic into easy to read functions split up by their usage
- Understanding targets and event bubbling to accurately identify element ids and manipulate the element

## Known Bugs
If a player wins before all the tiles are filled, the user can continue to click until they are all filled
