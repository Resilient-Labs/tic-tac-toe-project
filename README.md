## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used OOP for this project. I created a class called Game. I put all of the winning options using if else statemnets inside of a function inside of the Game class. Then I put a player turn function that changes between X and O to allow other people's turn to go, as well as a function to actually create an X and O on click. After that I created a final functon outside of the Game class object and created a clear game function button that will clear the entire game whenever pressed.

## Lessons Learned:

I realized OOP can make your code a lot easier to read and smooother to work with. Any Class you make will have a constructor in Javascript.
