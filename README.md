## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

This one was build from scratch as well, but was a bit more challenging as there were a lot of moving parts to keep track of placement to determine who wins and whos turn it is etc.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about interactivity with this assignment. Lots of new explosure in this one, like eventObjects, removing EventListeners and even get some practive in with nodelists rather than arrays.
